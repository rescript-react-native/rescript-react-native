# PREFER CONTRIBUTING TO reason-react-native

Current stable `bs-react-native` has entered a kind of frozen mode. We are
focusing on the rewrite, which is in `reason-react-native` & we would prefer to
get contribution in there. If that's necessary for you to get something in
`bs-react-native`, we would accept it as soon as we also have it (already or
added) in `reason-react-native`.
